# Bioinformatics-Peptide-Vaccine
This repository contains all the codes for graphical and numerical characterisation of nucleotide and amino acid sequences based on Nandy-graphical system for allotting coordinate axes to the nucleotide bases or amino acids. The repository also contains code to determine the solvent accessibility and degree of conservation for every 12-length contiguous amino acid in a sequence and determine possible candidates as vaccine targets. 

The following are the important points to noted about the input to be given to the codes:
